    *FOR CONFLICTING DATA TYPES: Error -> Cannot map to columns of different keys
		
	   1. Drag the Data Conversion Control and link it in between the Excel Source File and the SCD Control.
           2. Create new columns with the columns that have a conflicting data type. Set the new data type to its equivalent: 
		    System.int32  = DT_I4
		    System.double = DT_Decimal
		    Date = DT_DBDATE
		   
		> Refer to this: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/data-flow/integration-services-data-types?view=sql-server-ver16
 	
 	*FOR TRACK_DIM: 
		
		1. Drag a Derived Column control and place it inbetween the Excel Source Control and the Data Conversion control. We will be creating new columns and casting it with
    		   the appropriate SSIS data type.
		2. Name the derived column: duration_ss/duration_mn.
		3. Choose <add as new column> in the Derived Column column.
		4. In the Expression area input this:

	   3. After setting this new data type, go back to the SCD control and select all the NEW COLUMNS made in the Input column.

 19. Set the SCD Methodology for the fields in question:

       >SCD II (Historical attribute):     ARTIST                      TRACK
                                       Artist_Name, Artist_ID     Title, Track_ID

                                           DATE                        TRACK
       >SCD I (Changing attribute):    Release_Date, Year        Track_Number, Track_Type, Explicit, Duration_ms, Album_Type, Album_Total_Tracks, Active_Ind
 
       		                          FEATURE
                                      (all attributes)

      >NORMAL (Refer below):          Popularity_Streams

 20. Click Next. 
     IF (Historical attribute): Set the column to indicate current record to: Active_Ind
                                Set value when current: 1
                                Set value when expired: 0
     IF (Changing attribute): Click next again.
 21. Check the Enable inferred member support box. Check the Changing attributes box. Click Finish.
 22. Click Start to start testing the mapping. All controls should show the green check icon.
 23. Load all rows in the SQL Server Management Studio by querying: SELECT * FROM [SpotifySP].[dbo].[DimTrack]
 24. Restart the mapping and reload the rows in SSMS and check if the rows remain at 61,351 and will not double. [NAH DONT DO THIS IT TAKES FOREVER]
 
 *If loading the Track_Dim has the error: [Excel Source [71]] Error: The attempt to add a row to the Data Flow task buffer failed with error code 0xC0047020.
	 1. Right click in the empty space in the Data Flow tab and click Properties.
	 2. Scroll down to ForcedExecutionValueType and set it to: Int64
	 3. If still encountering errors, make sure you have enough RAM.

    Artist_Dim, Date_Dim, Track_Dim, Features_Dim
 
 (Artist_Dim should load 36,625 rows)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 [GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR NORMAL DIMENSION]

 14. Drag the OLE DB Destination control onto the canvas. 
 15. Rename it to: Date Dimension
 16. Link the blue arrow from Product Control to the Date Dimension. Double-click the Date Dimension control. 
 17. Click New... to create a new connection. And click New... again.
 18. For the server name, name it to the same name as step A2.
 19. Set the authentication to: Windows Authentication 
 20. Set the database name to: SpotifySP
 21. Click OK until you are back to the OLE DB Destination Editor window.
 22. Set the connection manager to: [Device Name].SpotifySP
 23. In the dropdown menu for the name of the table, click: dbo.DimDate
 24. On the left side, click Mappings.
 25. Check if all the columns are mapped to each other EXCEPT date_key -> Date_key. If there is a line, right-click the line and delete the mapping.
 26. Click OK. The Date Dimension control should have the triangle error icon.
 27. Click Start at the top to test the mapping.
 28. The mapping should display the green check icon. Then click Stop to stop the mapping.
 29. Go back to Microsoft SQL Server Management studio to verify if the rows were loaded.
 30. Load all the rows by querying: SELECT * FROM [SpotifySP].[dbo].[DimDate]

> TABLES LOADED CORRECTLY:
    Popularity_Streams,

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOADING FACT TABLE]

*MAKE SURE ALL DIMENSIONS ARE LOADED FIRST BEFORE LOADING THE FACT TABLE

 1. Drag a Data Conversion column and convert all the foreign keys to: DT_I4
 2. Drag a Lookup Transformation control and link it between the Data Conversion control and the OLE DB Destinaton (not an SCD as fact tables dont track changes over time, just add new rows)
 3. In General, set these:
		Cache mode: Full
		Connection type: OLE DB Connection Manager
		Redirect rows to error output (Connect a Flat File Destination to the OLE DB to redirect error outputs for debugging)
 4. In Connection, connect to the database SpotifySP.
 5. In Columns, connect the newly created column from the Data Conversion and link it in the corresponding column in the Available Lookup Columns.
 6. Repeat process of Lookup transformation for each foreign key and just chain these controls to each other.
 7. Double-check the column mapping.
 8. Display all rows: SELECT * FROM [SpotifySP].[dbo].[StreamsPopular_Fact]
    Should be 36,625 rows.

 *Artist_Dim will have errors, redirect the rows to a Flat File Destination. 
 The rows with problems are 24,726 rows that were removed during ETL in the previous step.

*LOAD THIS ONLY ONCE! This isn't an SCD table and so the rows in the database WILL DOUBLE.
